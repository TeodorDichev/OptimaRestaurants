# OptimaRestaurants

# Purpose
OptimaRestaurants is an ASP.NET Core and Angular web-application meant to participate in different software-development competitions.

# Functionalities
OptimaRestaurants is an online application aimed at simplifying the work of waiters and restaurateurs by providing them with a secure online environment for monitoring, optimizing and digitizing the work process, by giving and receiving grades, organizing schedules, generating resumes (CVs) and others.

Many opportunities will open up to waiters registered in the system. Each of them will be provided with a QR code through which they can be evaluated from their customers. They will be able to download automatically generated summaries containing their personal information, their previous work experience and their current workplace. The app will assists them in organizing schedules. Through OptimaRestaurants, they will also have the opportunity to apply for a job.

Restaurant managers are our most valuable customer and therefore those who who get the most from using OptimaRestaurants. They can register their restaurants, hire workers in them, organize their schedules and monitor the quality of their employees' work online, giving them the opportunity for optimization and digitization of the work process.

For the average user, OptimaRestaurant offers reliable and secure system to discover the best restaurants in the area, as well as a tool to express an opinion towards the restaurant and service staff.

# Future
For the future, we have an idea to add an English version, which will increase the popularity of OptimaRestaurants, as well as other roles such as: "Bartender", "Cook". We would also like to allow the possibility of a unique role for each restaurant whose rights to be defined by the manager, as well as adding shifts to be automatically distributed in the workers' schedule. In addition, we plan to add the possibility of transferring the rights of the manager to an employee who will occupy the role of deputy while the manager is absent. The most important thing we hope to achieve is to find a way to prevent the exploitation of the system of giving ratings for restaurant and worker, without having to implement registration.
